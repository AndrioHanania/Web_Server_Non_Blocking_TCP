# Web_Server_Non_Blocking_TCP

This is a web server (non blocking) that works on the TCP communication protocol.
The server is written in CPP.
The server supports several types of client requests for example: POST, DELETE TRACE and more.
The server supports file operations.
For example, creating a new file, writing to it, deleting it and more.
If you want to test the server and play on it, I recommend using the POSTMAN software.
